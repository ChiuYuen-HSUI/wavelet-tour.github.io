Welcome to the home page of the Wavelet Tour book
---------------

This web page gathers materials to complement the third edition of the book _A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing, 3rd edition, The Sparse Way, of [Stéphane Mallat](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/)_. In particular you can download all the [figures](figures/) from the book and perform [numerical experiments](numerics/) using [Matlab](http://fr.mathworks.com/products/matlab/), [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/fr) or [Python](https://www.python.org/). Solutions of problems from the book [can also be obtained](exercises/).

About the Third Edition
---------------

The new edition of this classic book gives all the major concepts, techniques and applications of sparse representation, reflecting the key role the subject plays in today's signal processing. The book clearly presents the standard representations with Fourier, wavelet and time-frequency transforms, and the construction of orthogonal bases with fast algorithms. The central concept of sparsity is explained and applied to signal compression, noise reduction, and inverse problems, while coverage is given to sparse representations in redundant dictionaries, super-resolution and compressive sensing applications.

A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing: The Sparse Way, third edition, is an invaluable resource for researchers and R/D engineers wishing to apply the theory in fields such as image processing, video processing and compression, bio-sensing, medical imaging, machine vision and communications engineering. [Stéphane Mallat](https://www.di.ens.fr/~mallat/) is Professor in Applied Mathematics at [ENS](http://www.ens.fr/), Paris, France. From 1986 to 1996 he was a Professor at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cims.nyu.edu/) at New York University, and between 2001 and 2007, he co-founded and became CEO of an image processing semiconductor company.
