You can retrieve all the figures as a single [zip file](/files/figs.zip).

Figures from chapters 1 to 11 can be reproduced using the [Wavelab Matlab toolbox](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/). The Wavelab directory has a folder called WaveTour. It contains a subdirectory for each chapter WTCh01, WTCh02, .); these subdirectories include all the files needed to reproduce the computational figures from chapters 1 to 11. Each directory has a demo file.

Many of the figures of the books (including most of the numerical experiments of chapters 12 and 13) can be obtained by going through the [numerical tours](/numerics/).
